# BasedBase
This is a client base for clients on minecraft forge 1.12.2. <br />
You may use this in any project of your own, it would be appreciated if you were to credit me, and please respect the liscence. <br />
<br />
The purpose of this project is for me to learn more about coding in a minecraft/forge enviorment. Everything here will be custom coded aside from the event system because alpine based. Also, this may be helpful to others as the only other bases atm seem to be outdated or just unfinished, although I recommend coding your own base. The only refrenced libraries will be Alpine 1.5 and Spongepowered for mixins. <br />
